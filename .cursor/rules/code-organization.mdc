## Code organization
- Organize code based on Symfony's directory structure:
  - Use the correct namespace conventions: `App\...`
  - Follow the Symfony 6 directory structure
  - Put controllers in `src/Controller/`
  - Put entities in `src/Entity/`
  - Put services in `src/Service/`
  - Put forms in `src/Form/`
  - Put repositories in `src/Repository/`
  - Put event subscribers in `src/EventSubscriber/`
  - Put command handlers in `src/Command/`

- Test organization:
  - Tests dirs should be numbered: Topic**
  - Implementation dirs (Controllers, Services, etc.) should be named based on the topic (e.g. HttpCaching)
  - Put tests under `tests/Topic**/` dir and do not create subdirectories
  - Create a test file named in Topic**Test.php and put the majority of tests there
  - If Symfony provides a specialized testing toolset (like Symfony\Component\Form\Test\TypeTestCase), create a separate file to demonstrate how a test should be written

- Configuration organization:
  - Place configuration in the appropriate files under `config/`
  - Use YAML for configuration files when possible
  - Place routes in `config/routes.yaml` or using annotations/attributes
  - Place services configuration in `config/services.yaml`
  - Use environment variables and .env files appropriately
